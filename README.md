# Source code of the game which is named Journey of the Slayer
Journey of the Slayer is a roguelike turn based isometric strategy game where you kill demons to protect human villages.

I wrote the game in C language with Raylib library. Raylib is the only dependancy of this code. 

You can examine or use the code as you wish. I don't claim any right or responsibility on the code.

Some of the games assets like textures and fonts doesn't belong to me(I donwloaded them from Internet), so I can't give you the right to use them.
